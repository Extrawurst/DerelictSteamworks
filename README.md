# DerelictSteamworks [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Extrawurst/DerelictSteamworks.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Extrawurst/DerelictSteamworks)

Supports Steamworks flat-api SDK: 1.37 (from 05/23/2016)

*work in progress*

*note:* the overlay rendering does not work on osx right now. this seems to be a bug in the current steamworks lib

# instructions

to start the demo just run dub:
`dub`

see also the basic [DerelictOrg usage guide](https://derelictorg.github.io/using.html)

to be able to run the demo the steam api binary needs to be downloaded and put into this directory. you can grab it here: https://partner.steamgames.com/

# todo

* support all callback types
* refactor to the same file structure as in the original SDK to simplify updates
